# Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA) Collection

The Williams College Museum of Art is an innovative campus museum with a growing art collection at its heart. The [WCMA collection](https://wcma.williams.edu/collection/) includes works of art in all media ranging from ancient Egyptian, Assyrian, and Greco-Roman objects, Indian painting, African sculpture, photography, art of the U.S., and international modern and contemporary art. WCMA’s collection also features the world’s largest repository of work by the artist-brothers Maurice (1858-1924) and Charles Prendergast (1863-1948). WCMA has collected works of art uniquely suited for teaching; generations of Williams students have gone on to become museum directors, curators, gallerists, and educators.

WCMA is pioneering new ways to interact with the collection. In [Object Lab](https://wcma.williams.edu/exhibit/object-lab-4/), faculty select works of art that become lenses for classes to explore neuroscience, or botany, or religion. Collection objects are loaned to students through [WALLS](https://wcma.williams.edu/collection/walls/), encouraging long-term personal connections. The [Rose Study Gallery](https://wcma.williams.edu/teaching-with-art/college-faculty/#rose) allows artworks to be used in a classroom space. WCMA’s Reading Room encourages [timely public conversation](http://wcma.williams.edu/exhibit/basquiat/) around individual works of art. The release of this dataset is another way to open the collection for interaction, inspiration, research and innovative use.

This research dataset contains contains 15,635 records, representing all currently accessioned works of art in WCMA’s collection. It includes basic metadata for each artwork, including accession number, title, date, classification, medium, and dimensions.

At this time, the dataset is available in CSV format, encoded in UTF-8. While UTF-8 is the standard for multilingual character encodings, it is not correctly interpreted by Excel on a Mac. Users of Excel on a Mac can convert the UTF-8 to UTF-16 so the file can be imported correctly.

This data is provided “as is” for research purposes and you use this data at your own risk. Much of the information included in this dataset is not complete and has not been curatorially approved. WCMA offers the datasets as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind.

We plan to update the dataset with new and revised information on a regular basis. You are advised to regularly update your copy of the datasets to ensure you are using the best available information.
